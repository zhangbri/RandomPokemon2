# AND101 Project 6 - CYOAPI Part 2: RecyclerView Edition

Submitted by: **Brian Zhang**

Time spent: **3** hours spent in total

## Summary

**Pokemon Dictionary** is an android app that provides a scrollable and searchable list of Pokemon, utilizing the PokeAPI to fetch information. Users can view details about each Pokemon, including an image and name, with functionality to load data for a random Pokemon or search for one by name. The app enhances user interaction with features like infinite scrolling and search queries, making it a comprehensive tool for exploring Pokemon data.

If I had to describe this project in three (3) emojis, they would be: **ðŸ”¥ðŸ¥¬ðŸŒŠ**
